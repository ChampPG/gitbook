# Lab 12.1: Building a WLAN in Packet Tracer

### Summary

During this lab, we learned to set up wireless connections. This was a very daunting task as I have never seen a wireless router in packet tracer. To create a wireless network you want to go to the GUI tab and configure the network with your routing table if provided. Then go through the security tab and set up a passphrase if needed. We needed to connect the wireless router to a wired router and then a web server. This caused me a problem because I put down the LAN default gateway and not the Internet.
