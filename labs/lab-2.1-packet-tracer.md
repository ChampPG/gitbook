# Lab 2.1: Packet Tracer

### Summary

In this lab, we set up CISCO packet tracer and made one computer ping the another. I had no real problems during this lab setting it up was harder than the actual lab.

deploying the switches and Workstations was easy you just go to the bottom left and select network point then click on switches below that. Then for the workstations, you just go to the endpoint and select your workstation.

For connections click on the little lightning bolt that is to the right on the bottom left then select the autoselect connection which is a lightning bolt as well.

You can access the command-line terminal by clicking on one of the PC's then go to the desktop tab and click command prompt.
