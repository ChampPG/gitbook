# Lab 7.1: Tracing Routes

### Summary

During this lab, I didn't come across any confusion because I did most of this last semester in SYS-140. The one thing I did laugh at myself for was I saw it asking to use whois and I immediately went to the whois exe that you run with command prompt instead of the website then I realized I needed to use the website that was given. I did learn that the time it takes for traceroutes is a lot longer internationally than I thought and I was shocked at how fast the website could do traceroutes.
