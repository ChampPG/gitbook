# Lab 1.1: Network Connectivity Testing

### Summary

This lab was a basic network overview showing us how to use ipconfig, ping, tracert, and nslookup. I had a pretty easy time going through this lab because I have used all these commands before in SYS-140.

ipconfig shows IPv4, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway. ipconfig /all shows Physical address and DNS servers. ping lets you check and see if you can connect to an IP. tracert or traceroute shows you the step your computer must take to get to the IP location. nslookup shows the IP addresses for a domain and what the real name for the domain is.

I open command prompt by doing windows key + r then typing cmd or if I need to use a program like whois I would open cmd through file explorer.
