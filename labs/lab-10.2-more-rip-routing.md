# Lab 10.2: More RIP Routing

### Summary

This lab was very straight forward the only part I got hung up on was when I used the RIP GUI it made the network address 182.150.0.0 which confused me, but it still works because all the networks are under that address. The way to show the IP route table is to get the router to "name#" if in config type "exit" to get here or type enable if below then when at "name#" type "show ip route"
