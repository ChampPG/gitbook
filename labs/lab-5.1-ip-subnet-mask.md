# Lab 5.1: IP/Subnet Mask

### Summary

During this lab, I learned how to turn IP's and Subnet Masks into binary and understand the slash notation. As well as Idenity the Network ID and the host ID. To convert a single octet within an IP address you binary you first get the binary of the number you want then add 0's till you get to an 8-bit number. The network ID is the first 24-bits of the IP then the last 8-bits are the host ID. You can create a subnet ID by taking the host ID bits and turning it into the subnet ID by adding it to the network ID.
