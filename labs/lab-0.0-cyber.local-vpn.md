# Lab 0.0: Cyber.local VPN

### Summary

This lab was how to connect to the Cyber.Local remotely. It was relativity straight forward the only thing I want to leave here as an important step is you must be on the Champlain network to connect to the VMhorizon. I think the only problem I ran into was being about to do the remote desktop and click another user and not the default profile plus getting the correct screenshots needed.
