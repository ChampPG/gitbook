# Lab 11.1: VLANs Part 1

### Summary

This lab was pretty easy and there were little problems that needed to be worked around. To create the VLAN you go to the switch then VLAN database and add the number and name of the VLAN. To configure an access the port go to the desired interface then click on it and select the VLAN where it says 1. To configure a trunk do the same as the access port except chance access to trunk and select what VLANs you need.
