# Lab 3.2: Observing ARP in Packet Tracer

### Summary

We connected a network of 4 computers together using a switch and looked at the mac-address-table of the switch. The only problem I ran into was I forgot to set up the IP for PC2 and when I pinged it I was confused why it wasn't there. during this lab, I learned how to use the switch command lines a little. Setting the IP and Subnet Mask is easy you just click on the workstation you want and go to config then FastEthernet0 then type in the IP and Subnet Mask. you enter admin mode by making the prompt look like Switch (config)# the way you do this is by typing enable. to view the mac address table type show mac-address-table into the CLI prompt.
