# Lab 5.2: Subnetting Charts

### Summary

During this lab, we learned how to subnet a network. This lab was very confusing for me because trying to figure out how many bits it takes for 6 subents wasn't straightforward. To create a network you look at how many users you need. Then you will need to start with the largest network and choose a suitable address and determine the range of IPs. A broadcast address can be found by turning the IP to binary then turning the host ID into all 1's. To get the range of IPs first the smallest would just be a 1 at the end of the host IP then the highest IP is all 1s in the Host ID except for the last one.
