# Lab 1.0: Network Management

### Summary



### SNMP (Simple Network Protocol)

* RFC: 3411-3418
* Creation: Lucent Technologies December 2002
* Overview: SNMP is used to collect network data through UDP... (During the lab I enabled 161/TCP and that was rough). The reason SNMP collects data so it can change how a device works.

### Remote Management

I want to get more into remote management tools for example Remmina, VNCTiger. I am really interested in VNC because I haven't worked with it much. I really have only made it do so I can VNC into my desktop but it's very jankey.

### Other Firewalls Firmwares

* [DD-WRT](https://dd-wrt.com/support/router-database/): This is an OpenSource firmware that has been around for 13 years.DD-WRT supports more routers then Open-WRT
* [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/):This is another OpenSource firmware that has been around for 18 years. It is a little more tricky and harder to understand if not well
