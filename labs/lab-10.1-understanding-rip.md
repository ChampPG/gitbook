# Lab 10.1: Understanding RIP

### Summary

This lab was overall very easy and went smoothly it was especially easy since we did static routing right before this. You enable RIPv2 on a router by going to the CLI then getting into "config" mode then type "router rip" then enter that command and enter "version 2". The RIP-enable router should advertise the routing table from the router and show how to get to its own network. you type "network \_\_\_\_\_\_" the underscore is where you put the network you want advertised. To view a PDU you go into simulation then hit show all/none and then go to filters and click RIP then play it for a second and then click on the RIP packets between routers.
