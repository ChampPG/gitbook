# Lab 4.1: Simple Routing

### Summary

During this lab, we learned simple routing and how to set up a switch. Setting up the Gateway is very easy you just go to the workstation the click config and setting then type in the gateway you want. Setting the Multilayer Switch IP and Submask is about the same process except when you go to config you must select FastEthernet0/N. N is the port to which the computer is connected to. then in the IP spot, you put the gateway of the workstation. To enter simulation mode click simulation on the bottom left and select what type of packets you want to see by hitting edit filters.
