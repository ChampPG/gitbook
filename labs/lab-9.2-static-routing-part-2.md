# Lab 9.2: Static Routing Part 2

### Summary

During this lab we set up a subnet table this table was used to configure our setup in packet tracer. This setup contained an East and West side with Finance and Sales on both. The hard part of this lab I had to troubleshoot was I hit the wrong number when typing in the table and when copying and pasting I took the wrong number and had to figure out why a destination was unreachable. I made life easier for myself by instead of typing in the command and doing that 4 times over I just did the Static tab in the routers. When a router receives a packet it goes through its routing table to figure out what network this packet was made to go to. Then it sends it to the correct network.
