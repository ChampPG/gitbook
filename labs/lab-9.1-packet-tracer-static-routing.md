# Lab 9.1: Packet Tracer Static Routing

### Summary

During this lab, we learned how to set up a routing table and connect 3 networks. I had no problems completing this lab. Some key commands I want to write down are when you get into a router if it just shows "name>" then you must type enable to get "name#" then if you type config it shows up as "name(config)#". To enter a static route through the command-line you have to go to CLI and then get to config mode then type "ip route 'network' 'submask' 'next hop'". to show the routing table you want to be at where it just says the "name#" then type "show ip route"
