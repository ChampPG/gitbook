# Lab 6.2: Subnetting in Packet Tracer

### Summary

During this lab, we set up a subnet into 4 parts. This is a pretty straightforward lab except I didn't know that the default gateway could be the lowest IP available. The main notes I want to keep is that the default gateway can be any useable IP and when setting up a Router in Packet Tracer remember to turn on the ports.
