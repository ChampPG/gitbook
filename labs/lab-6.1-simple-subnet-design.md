# Lab 6.1: Simple Subnet Design

### Summary

This lab was pretty easy all around but it was really hard to get my head around what the new subnet mas in dotted-decimal would look like and why it became a /26 network. If you must support X equal-sized subnets, you will need the number of bits 2 is raised, so let's say you need 4 equal subnets 2 to the 2nd is 4 so you would need 2 bits.
