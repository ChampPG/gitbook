# Lab 3.1: ARP Observation

### Summary

During the lab today we looked at finding the request and replies for ARP's. During this lab, we learned how to sort Wireshark by just arp protocols. The one problem I had during the lab as I was in the wrong ethernet interface and wasn't seeing any arp packets to my default gateway. You can open admin command prompt by searching it then right-clicking and hitting run as admin. You can clear ARP cache by using the common netsh interface ip delete arpcache. To filter just for ARP packets type icmp into the search bar at the top of Wireshark.
