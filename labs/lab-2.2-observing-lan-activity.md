# Lab 2.2: Observing LAN Activity

### Summary

This lab was about pinging the default gateway and another address to see what we can find in Wireshark.

When Wireshark first opens you can select the interface there.

The filter we used was icmp which sorts out everything except for ping requests and replies.

You can find the MAC addresses when you click on one of the requests or replies. It's located on the second part where it says ethernet 2 and just to the right of that you can find the MAC addresses.

I had trouble finding the MAC addresses for each part and still don't know if I have it correct. The way I got around this sort of was just looking anywhere for a MAC address then looking if it was the correct one.
