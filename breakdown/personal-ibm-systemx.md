# Personal IBM SystemX

### Description:

**OS:** Proxmox

I am very much in favor of compartmentalization which is why I put everything into it's own VM. Tis gives me the ability to explore concepts and then just revert back to the last snap shot if I have is issue without effecting the other services running on the server.
