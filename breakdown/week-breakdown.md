### Week 2:

* More in depth subnetting
* [Lab 2.1: Subnet Design](../labs/lab-2.1-subnet-design.md) | Took a network setup with no configuration and used the [Subnet Table](../labs/lab-2.1-subnet-design.md#subnet-table) to setup the network.

* [Lab 3.3: DHCP Server in Packet Tracer](../labs/lab-3.3-dhcp-server-in-packet-tracer.md) | This lab built on how to get DHCP to work over different VLANs and how to setup DHCP pools

\=====================================================================

### Week 4:

* Design network for campus/enterprise
