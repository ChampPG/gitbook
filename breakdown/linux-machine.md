OS: Was Manjaro now switching to Fedora

This machine has been my daily driver for the past year. It has gone through a ton of changes but, I am looking for something new now which is why I am switching from Manjaro to Fedora. I was using Manjaro XFCE and I will be using a "Spin" of Fedora which has XFCE has it's Desktop Environment.&#x20;
